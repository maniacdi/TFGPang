### Pang - Final Degree Project
This is the repository for my final degree project in software engineering, where I recreated the classic arcade game Pang using C# and Unity. In addition to recreating the original game, I added several new features and enhancements to make the game more enjoyable and engaging.

## Gameplay
Pang is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character armed with a harpoon gun, tasked with popping balloons that bounce around the screen. The game is divided into levels, and each level consists of a series of screens that the player must complete by popping all the balloons on each screen. The player must avoid touching the balloons or any other obstacles on the screen, as doing so will result in the loss of a life.

In my version of Pang, I have added several new features and enhancements to make the game more interesting and challenging. Some of the new features include:

New power-ups that give the player temporary enhancements, such as faster movement, extra lives, and invincibility.
New enemy types with unique behaviors and attack patterns, such as homing missiles and kamikaze enemies.

## Technologies Used
The game was built using C# and Unity, with Visual Studio Code as the primary development environment. The graphics and sound effects were created using various tools and resources available online, including free assets from the Unity Asset Store.

## Installation and Usage
To play the game, you will need to download and install the latest version of Unity from the official website. Once you have installed Unity, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open it in Unity to build and run the game.
